            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2020, Shamba Palace emerged from a deep understanding of the challenges faced by Kenyan farmers. 
            Our founder, having grown up in a farming family in Chuka, witnessed firsthand how limited access to modern 
            farming equipment held back agricultural progress in many communities. What started as a small equipment rental 
            service with just two tractors has now grown into one of Kenya's leading agricultural machinery providers.</p>
            
            <p>Through partnerships with local farming cooperatives and international equipment manufacturers, we've built 
            a comprehensive fleet of modern machinery that serves hundreds of farmers across the country. Our journey has 
            been marked by continuous learning, adaptation, and a steadfast commitment to our farming communities.</p>
